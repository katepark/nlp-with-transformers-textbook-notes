# Transformers Notebooks

This repository contains my notes from Hugging Face's O'Reilly book [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/):

## Getting started

I ran notebooks on Google Colab and commented throughout if I changed anything. Scroll to end of notebook for other insights :)

* Chapter 01. This chapter was very straightforward. My only advice being to use the Colab notebook (vs. setting up everything locally)
* Chapter 02. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17ceCwNVIfve6ltm3YDH15VqgFQdEXDuA) Scroll to end for Case Study on "Tesla". Using chapter 02, I started extending my "Laughbot" (classifying humor) here https://github.com/katepark/laughbot-transformer
* Chapter 03. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1x990ATYy4tcP_o90s1aZfWUaQWW0Jtpm#scrollTo=zJreJb75yh0C) Scroll to end for implementions of Decoder Layer and Encoder-Decoder Layers from scratch
